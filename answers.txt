1. How does CI/CD improve collaboration in ML teams?
Ans. Consistency: Same automated steps for everyone (prep, train, eval).
Fast feedback: Breaks found early on every push/PR.
Reproducibility: Versioned runs with logged artifacts.
Transparency: Team sees status/results in one place.
Quality gates: Only good models pass.

2. What happens if the evaluation score is below the threshold?
Ans. The eval step fails.
The workflow run is marked failed.
Artifacts aren’t released/deployed.
Team sees the failure and fixes the issue.

3. How can retraining or drift detection be integrated?
Ans. Scheduled runs (cron) to retrain regularly.
Drift checks before/after training (feature/label distribution checks).
Monitoring hooks: trigger retrain if live metrics degrade.
Auto-actions: open issues/notify Slack, or kick off retrain.

4. Steps to deploy this workflow to production (AWS/Kubernetes)
Ans. Build + push image to a registry (ECR/DockerHub).
Store model in S3/registry and version it.
Provision serving:
AWS: SageMaker endpoint or ECS/Fargate service.
K8s: Deployment + Service (+ HPA).
Wire secrets/config (env vars, Secrets Manager/K8s Secrets).
Add CI deploy job on success (main/tag).
Ops: health checks, monitoring, logging, rollback.
